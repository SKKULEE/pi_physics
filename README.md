# pi_physics
Calculating pi by 1-dimensional elastic collision model simulation.  

### Introduction
This program is built to show that counting 1-dimensional elastic collisions can derive the value of pi.  

The hyperlinked video below is what I referenced and there are all the details about what this program exactly do.

### How to Use
![experiment_state](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100181857/155082583-1ecbec4a-a420-42f9-a109-e4b64cd400eb.png)  
The initial state of the program is "experiment".  
"RS" button is used for entering "Setting" state.  
"RUN/PAUSE" button is used for pausing/resuming the current experiment.  
"Collisions" displays the number of collisions occurred in the current experiment.

If you enter "Setting" state by clicking "RS" button, all the experiment information are deleted, and you can set new experiment information.  
Size: Set the size of a collider (unit: meter)  
Mass: Set the Mass of the collider (unit: kilogram)  
Position: Set the initial position of the collider (unit: meter)  
Velocity: Set the initial velocity of the collider (unit: m/s)  
Color: Set the color of the collider (default: random)  
"ADD" button is used for adding new collider data by given information.  
"DONE" button is used for entering "experiment" state with the current experiment information.    

### Initial state
The program state is "experiment" state and two initial colliders' information are as follows:  
collider1 - size 1, mass 1, position 2, velocity 0, color RED  
collider2 - size 1, mass 1, position 5, velocity -1, color BLUE  

### Note
note1: All the information for colliders can be any integer/decimal, but using integers only is recommended.  
note2: RED, GREEN, BLUE, BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, MAGENTA, CYAN are valid colors.  
note3: Entering some invalid data (ex: negative mass) is not prohibited, but it may cause unexpected malfunctions.  
note4: Changing window size is not fully supported.
